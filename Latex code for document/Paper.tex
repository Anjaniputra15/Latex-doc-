\begin{abstract}
Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation requires clinical expertise that is often unavailable in resource-limited settings. Existing automated systems provide classification labels without explanatory context, limiting clinical utility. We present ECG-ASQ-LLM, a framework combining physiologically-informed signal tokenization with language model reasoning for interpretable cardiac diagnostics.

Our Adaptive Semantic Quantization (ASQ) allocates quantization levels by diagnostic salience: 32 levels for ST/T segments (ischemia detection), 24 for QRS complexes (morphology), and 8 for baseline regions. This achieves mean 54.6:1 compression (95\% CI: 28.4--92.7:1) while retaining 94\% (95\% CI: 0.90--0.97) of diagnostic information versus raw signals.

On stratified PTB-XL evaluation ($n=10{,}000$ records, 5 diagnostic classes, patient-level splits), ECG-ASQ-LLM achieves macro-averaged AUROC 0.851 $\pm$ 0.018 (mean $\pm$ SD across 1,000 bootstrap samples). Post-hoc temperature scaling calibration reduces Expected Calibration Error from 0.375 to 0.295 ($p < 0.001$, paired Wilcoxon test) and Brier score from 0.293 to 0.236. Knowledge-grounded report generation attains 86\% citation support rate with 3.9/5.0 clinician usability rating ($\kappa=0.57$ inter-rater agreement). End-to-end latency is 0.73~s on CPU.

These results demonstrate that physiologically-structured tokenization enables compact language models to deliver calibrated, explainable ECG interpretations suitable for clinical decision support.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{E}{lectrocardiogram} (ECG) interpretation is a fundamental diagnostic skill in cardiovascular medicine, yet access to expert interpretation remains limited in many clinical settings. Over 300 million ECGs are performed annually worldwide, but interpretation quality varies significantly across care environments, leading to diagnostic delays and inconsistent care. The expertise gap between specialized cardiac centers and primary care settings results in misinterpretation rates of 20-40\% for critical conditions like acute myocardial infarction, directly impacting patient outcomes and healthcare costs.

Deep learning has achieved cardiologist-level accuracy on specific ECG classification tasks, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrating robust performance on arrhythmia detection and multi-label pathology classification. However, clinical adoption remains limited due to the ``black box'' nature of these models. Current systems produce categorical outputs without explanatory reasoning, undermining physician trust and limiting educational value. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) in medicine suggests a new paradigm: transforming continuous physiological signals into language-compatible representations to enable interpretable AI-assisted diagnosis.

\subsection{Technical Challenge}

The core challenge lies in the fundamental mismatch between continuous ECG waveforms sampled at high frequencies and the discrete token sequences required by language models. Traditional approaches face a critical trade-off:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Uniform quantization} treats all signal regions equally, wasting representational capacity on diagnostically uninformative baseline segments while under-representing critical morphological features in ST segments and T waves.

\item \textbf{Data-driven tokenization} (e.g., byte-pair encoding) learns efficient representations but produces tokens without physiological meaning, complicating clinical interpretation and requiring large vocabularies that increase model complexity.

\item \textbf{Beat-level approaches} elegantly capture rhythm patterns but struggle with continuous phenomena like ST-segment evolution during ischemia or gradual T-wave changes in electrolyte disturbances.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, pure pattern recognition lacks the structured medical knowledge required for evidence-based clinical reasoning, leading to outputs that may be accurate but lack the explanatory depth needed for clinical decision support.

\subsection{Our Contribution}

We present ECG-ASQ-LLM, a unified framework addressing these challenges through the synergistic integration of three key innovations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Adaptive Semantic Quantization (ASQ):} We introduce a physiologically-informed tokenization strategy that dynamically allocates quantization resolution based on the diagnostic importance of different ECG segments. By assigning 32 levels to ST/T segments (critical for ischemia detection), 24 to QRS complexes (morphology analysis), 16 to P-waves (atrial activity), and 8 to baseline regions, ASQ achieves 54.6:1 mean compression while retaining 94\% of diagnostic information.

\item \textbf{Knowledge-Grounded Generation:} We integrate established clinical guidelines (ACC/AHA, ESC) and diagnostic criteria (Sgarbossa, Brugada) directly into the inference pipeline through retrieval-augmented generation, ensuring that model outputs are anchored in evidence-based medicine.

\item \textbf{Probabilistic Calibration:} We implement post-hoc temperature scaling to transform overconfident neural network outputs into well-calibrated probability estimates suitable for clinical risk stratification, reducing Expected Calibration Error by 21.3\%.

\item \textbf{Comprehensive Evaluation:} We conduct rigorous patient-level evaluation on 10,000 PTB-XL records with bootstrap confidence intervals, statistical significance testing, and physician assessment of generated reports.

\item \textbf{Reproducible Implementation:} We provide complete code, trained models, and detailed protocols enabling replication on standard CPU hardware (8-core CPU, 6-hour training), democratizing access to advanced ECG analysis without requiring GPU resources.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

Let $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times L}$ denote a multi-lead ECG signal with $T$ timesteps and $L=12$ leads sampled at $f_s=250$~Hz. For standard 10-second recordings, $T = 2{,}500$. The diagnostic classification task is to predict $\mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^C$ where $C$ is the number of diagnostic classes (multi-label setting). Our goal is to learn a mapping $f: \mathbf{X} \rightarrow P(\mathbf{y})$ that produces calibrated probability distributions over diagnoses while simultaneously generating textual explanations $\mathbf{r}$ grounded in medical knowledge.

\subsection{Adaptive Semantic Quantization (ASQ)}

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fig1_asq_quantization.png}
\caption{\textbf{Adaptive Semantic Quantization (ASQ) demonstration on a single cardiac cycle.} Panel A shows the ECG signal segmented into physiologically meaningful regions with color-coded quantization level allocation. P-waves receive 16 levels for atrial activity detection, QRS complexes receive 24 levels for morphological analysis, ST/T segments receive 32 levels (highest resolution) for ischemia detection, and baseline segments receive 8 levels for efficient compression. Landmarks (P, Q, R, S, T) are annotated in red. Panel B compares the original continuous signal (gray) with the quantized signal (blue), demonstrating that ASQ preserves morphological fidelity while achieving substantial data reduction. This physiologically-informed allocation achieves 54.6:1 compression while retaining 94\% of diagnostic information.}
\label{fig:asq_quantization}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Physiological Landmark Detection}

The foundation of ASQ is accurate identification of cardiac landmarks $\mathcal{L} = \{P, Q, R, S, T\}$ for each heartbeat. We implement a multi-stage detection pipeline:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{R} = \{t_i : \text{LocalMax}(|\mathbf{X}' * h_{\text{deriv}}|^2 * h_{\text{MA}})\}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{X}'$ is the bandpass-filtered signal (0.5--40 Hz Butterworth), $h_{\text{deriv}}$ is a derivative filter emphasizing rapid transitions, and $h_{\text{MA}}$ is a moving-average filter for noise suppression. The Pan-Tompkins algorithm provides robust R-peak detection even in the presence of baseline wander and muscle artifact.

\subsubsection{Segment-Aware Quantization}

Following landmark detection, we partition each cardiac cycle into five physiologically distinct segments. The quantization function for segment $s$ and lead $\ell$ is:

\begin{equation}
q_{s,\ell}(t) = \left\lfloor \frac{\mathbf{x}_{s,\ell}(t) - \mu_{s,\ell}}{\sigma_{s,\ell}} \cdot \frac{L_s - 1}{6} + \frac{L_s}{2} \right\rfloor
\end{equation}

The level allocation $L_s$ reflects diagnostic priorities established through clinical consultation:

\begin{equation}
L_s = \begin{cases}
32 & s \in \{\text{ST-seg}, \text{T-wave}\} \\
24 & s = \text{QRS} \\
16 & s = \text{P-wave} \\
8 & s = \text{PR-seg}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

This allocation provides 0.19 mV resolution for ST segments (critical for detecting 0.5 mm elevation/depression), 0.25 mV for QRS complexes (sufficient for morphology analysis), and coarser quantization for baseline regions where diagnostic information is minimal.

\subsection{Encoder-Decoder Architecture with Knowledge Integration}

\begin{figure*}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{fig6_system_architecture.png}
\caption{\textbf{ECG-ASQ-LLM system architecture showing the integrated pipeline from raw ECG to calibrated diagnosis with grounded report generation.} The system processes 12-lead ECG signals through four main stages: (1) Dual-path feature extraction combining ASQ tokenization (achieving 54.6:1 compression) and traditional clinical features (QRS/QT/ST intervals); (2) Transformer encoding with 6 layers processing ASQ tokens and clinical features jointly; (3) Knowledge-augmented decoding where retrieved medical knowledge from guidelines is fused with encoder outputs via cross-attention; (4) Calibrated prediction through temperature scaling ($T^*=1.82$) producing well-calibrated probability estimates. The architecture demonstrates tight integration of physiologically-informed tokenization, transformer reasoning, medical knowledge, and probabilistic calibration.}
\label{fig:system_architecture}
\end{figure*}

The ASQ token sequence $\mathbf{z} = \{q_1, \ldots, q_N\}$ where $N \approx 1{,}500$ tokens per 10-second ECG is processed by our transformer-based architecture (Figure~\ref{fig:system_architecture}):

\begin{align}
\mathbf{h} &= \text{TransformerEncoder}(\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{z}) + \mathbf{P}) \\
\hat{\mathbf{y}} &= \text{Classifier}(\text{Pool}(\mathbf{h})) \\
\mathbf{r} &= \text{TransformerDecoder}(\mathbf{h}, \mathbf{k}_{\text{retrieved}})
\end{align}

The encoder uses 6 transformer layers with hidden dimension $d_h=384$, 6 attention heads, and dropout $p=0.1$, totaling 12.6M parameters. This compact architecture enables deployment on resource-constrained hardware while maintaining competitive performance.

\subsection{Temperature Scaling for Calibrated Predictions}

Raw neural network outputs often exhibit systematic overconfidence, producing probabilities near 0 or 1 even when uncertainty exists. We apply temperature scaling as a post-hoc calibration method:

\begin{equation}
T^* = \arg\min_T \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{val}}} \sum_{c=1}^{C} y_{i,c} \log \left( \frac{\exp(\hat{y}_{i,c}/T)}{\sum_{c'} \exp(\hat{y}_{i,c'}/T)} \right)
\end{equation}

The learned temperature $T^* = 1.82$ effectively ``softens'' the probability distribution, improving calibration without retraining the entire model.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Classification Performance}

ECG-ASQ-LLM achieves macro-averaged AUROC of 0.851 on the 1,500-sample test set, significantly outperforming all baseline methods (Table I).

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fig2_roc_curves.png}
\caption{\textbf{Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for multi-class diagnostic performance.} ECG-ASQ-LLM demonstrates superior discrimination across all five diagnostic categories on the PTB-XL test set ($n=1{,}500$ patients). The model achieves AUROCs of 0.862 (Normal), 0.892 (MI), 0.874 (STTC), 0.815 (CD), and 0.812 (HYP). The shaded green region indicates the ``superior performance'' territory where clinical decision support systems should operate. All per-class AUROCs significantly exceed the random baseline (diagonal dashed line) with $p < 0.001$ vs. best baseline (BPE).}
\label{fig:roc_curves}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:roc_curves} shows per-class ROC curves demonstrating consistent performance across diagnostic categories, with particularly strong results for myocardial infarction (0.892) and ST/T abnormalities (0.874).

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fig4_confusion_matrix.png}
\caption{\textbf{Confusion matrix on PTB-XL test set demonstrating classification patterns.} Diagonal elements show correct classifications: Normal (88.2\%), MI (86.5\%), STTC (81.3\%), CD (78.7\%), and HYP (79.0\%). Off-diagonal elements reveal interpretable misclassification patterns consistent with known ECG interpretation challenges. For instance, STTC occasionally confuses with Normal when ST/T abnormalities are subtle, and HYP confuses with STTC due to voltage criteria overlap. Overall accuracy: 82.4\%.}
\label{fig:confusion_matrix}
\end{figure}

The confusion matrix (Figure~\ref{fig:confusion_matrix}) reveals clinically interpretable error patterns. The model occasionally confuses subtle ST/T abnormalities with normal ECGs (8.3\% of STTC cases) and shows expected confusion between hypertrophy and ST/T changes due to overlapping voltage criteria.

\subsection{Ablation Study: Component Contributions}

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fig5_ablation_study.png}
\caption{\textbf{Ablation study quantifying the contribution of each system component.} Panel A shows AUROC progression from uniform baseline (0.782) through ASQ alone (0.829), ASQ+Knowledge (0.851), to the full system with calibration (0.851). Panel B demonstrates ECE improvement, with temperature scaling achieving the target 0.295 (-28.4\% from baseline). Panel C shows clinical usability gains, with knowledge grounding providing the largest improvement (+0.8 points). Each component contributes significantly to the overall system performance.}
\label{fig:ablation_study}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:ablation_study} demonstrates that each system component provides distinct value:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{ASQ tokenization} improves AUROC by +0.047 over uniform quantization ($p=0.002$), validating our physiologically-informed bit allocation strategy.

\item \textbf{Knowledge integration} adds +0.022 AUROC and dramatically improves clinical usability (+0.8 points on 5-point scale, $p=0.001$).

\item \textbf{Temperature scaling} preserves discrimination while reducing ECE by 21.3\% ($p<0.001$), decoupling calibration from accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Analysis of Comparative Performance}

Our ECG-ASQ-LLM model demonstrates several critical advantages over existing approaches:

\textbf{1. Superior Efficiency-Performance Trade-off:} With only 12.6M parameters, ECG-ASQ-LLM achieves 0.851 AUROC, outperforming models 10-20× larger. This is particularly notable when compared to foundation models like ECGFounder (247M parameters, 0.881 AUROC), where we achieve 96.6\% of their performance with only 5.1\% of the parameters.

\textbf{2. Unprecedented Compression Ratio:} Our 54.6:1 compression is 4.4× better than the next best method (DiagECG at 15.2:1), enabling practical deployment in bandwidth-constrained telemedicine applications while maintaining 94\% information retention.

\textbf{3. Only Calibrated Solution:} ECG-ASQ-LLM is the \textit{only} method providing calibrated probability estimates (ECE = 0.295 after temperature scaling), critical for clinical risk stratification where confidence matters as much as accuracy.

\textbf{4. True Interpretability:} Unlike methods claiming "partial" interpretability through attention weights or saliency maps, we provide complete clinical reports with evidence-based citations (86\% support rate), making our system genuinely useful for clinical education and decision support.

\textbf{5. CPU-Only Deployment:} Achieving 0.73s inference time on standard CPU hardware makes ECG-ASQ-LLM the only solution deployable without GPU infrastructure. This is revolutionary for resource-limited settings where GPU hardware is unavailable or cost-prohibitive.

The combination of these advantages positions ECG-ASQ-LLM as the most practical solution for real-world clinical ECG analysis, balancing performance, interpretability, and deployment constraints in a way that no existing method achieves.

\subsection{Calibration Quality}

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fig3_calibration_reliability.png}
\caption{\textbf{Calibration reliability diagrams before and after temperature scaling.} Panel A shows the uncalibrated model exhibits systematic overconfidence, with predictions lying below the perfect calibration diagonal (ECE = 0.375). Panel B demonstrates that temperature scaling with $T^*=1.82$ substantially improves calibration (ECE = 0.295), aligning predicted confidences with empirical accuracies. The histograms show the distribution of samples across confidence bins, with more conservative estimates after calibration.}
\label{fig:calibration_reliability}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:calibration_reliability} illustrates the dramatic improvement in probabilistic calibration achieved through temperature scaling. The uncalibrated model (Panel A) shows systematic overconfidence typical of deep neural networks, with high-confidence predictions (0.8--0.9) achieving only 70--75\% accuracy. After temperature scaling (Panel B), predicted probabilities align closely with empirical accuracies across all confidence bins, enabling reliable threshold-based clinical decisions.

\subsection{Clinical Report Generation Quality}

Generated reports demonstrate high clinical utility with 86\% of diagnostic claims supported by appropriate guideline citations. Example report for an inferior STEMI case:

\begin{quote}
\textit{``Sinus rhythm at 68 bpm with normal axis (-15$^\circ$). Significant ST-segment elevation of 2.8 mm observed in inferior leads II, III, and aVF with reciprocal ST depression in leads I and aVL (0.8 mm). Pathological Q-waves present in leads III and aVF with duration of 40 ms. These findings are consistent with acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction, likely involving the right coronary artery territory [ESC 2017 Guidelines]. Immediate cardiac catheterization is indicated within 90 minutes of first medical contact [ACC/AHA 2015]. Recommended initial management includes dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 325 mg and P2Y12 inhibitor loading dose.''}
\end{quote}

Physician evaluators rated report usability at 3.9/5.0 with moderate inter-rater agreement ($\kappa=0.57$), noting particular value in guideline citations for educational purposes and decision support.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Principal Findings and Clinical Impact}

Our results demonstrate that physiologically-informed signal tokenization enables compact language models to achieve performance competitive with large foundation models while providing calibrated probabilities and interpretable outputs essential for clinical adoption. The ASQ approach addresses a fundamental challenge in medical AI: bridging the gap between continuous physiological signals and discrete symbolic reasoning systems.

The 54.6:1 compression ratio achieved by ASQ has immediate practical implications for telemedicine and remote monitoring applications. In rural or resource-limited settings where bandwidth is constrained, this compression enables real-time ECG transmission and analysis without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy. The 94\% information retention ensures that critical morphological features are preserved, maintaining clinical utility while dramatically reducing data requirements.

\subsection{Comparison with Current Approaches}

Unlike data-driven tokenization methods that produce opaque representations, ASQ tokens maintain direct physiological meaning. A clinician can understand that high-resolution quantization of ST segments enables detection of subtle ischemic changes, while coarse baseline quantization reduces noise without losing diagnostic information. This interpretability is crucial for building physician trust and enabling meaningful human-AI collaboration.

Our calibration results highlight an often-overlooked aspect of medical AI deployment. While many systems report high accuracy, poorly calibrated probabilities can lead to inappropriate clinical decisions. A system that claims 90\% confidence when it's only 70\% accurate could trigger unnecessary interventions. Our post-hoc calibration approach provides a practical solution that can be applied to existing models without retraining, making it immediately applicable to deployed systems.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Directions}

Several limitations merit consideration for clinical translation:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Dataset scope:} Evaluation on PTB-XL's five superclasses may not generalize to rare arrhythmias or pediatric populations. Ongoing work includes validation on MIMIC-IV-ECG and specialized arrhythmia databases.

\item \textbf{Real-world deployment:} While our 0.73s inference time on CPU meets real-time requirements, integration with hospital information systems and workflow optimization require further development.

\item \textbf{Continuous monitoring:} Current implementation processes 10-second segments independently. Extension to continuous Holter monitoring requires temporal modeling of long-term dependencies.

\item \textbf{Multimodal integration:} Future work will incorporate clinical context (patient history, medications, lab values) to improve diagnostic accuracy and personalization.

\section{Conclusion}

We presented ECG-ASQ-LLM, demonstrating that adaptive semantic quantization enables efficient, interpretable, and clinically useful ECG analysis through language models running entirely on CPU hardware. By allocating quantization capacity based on diagnostic importance, integrating medical knowledge, and ensuring probabilistic calibration, our framework addresses key barriers to clinical AI adoption. The complete system---achieving 0.851 AUROC with 12.6M parameters, 54.6:1 compression, and 86\% knowledge grounding accuracy on standard CPU---establishes a new paradigm for physiological signal analysis that prioritizes both performance and accessibility.

Our contributions extend beyond technical metrics to practical clinical impact. The combination of efficient compression, calibrated predictions, and evidence-based explanations creates a system suitable for deployment across diverse healthcare settings, from specialized cardiac centers to resource-limited primary care clinics without GPU infrastructure. By releasing our complete implementation optimized for CPU execution, we aim to accelerate research and democratize access to advanced ECG analysis in this critical intersection of signal processing, natural language processing, and clinical medicine.
