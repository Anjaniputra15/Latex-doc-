ECG-LLM Project Documentation
=============================

## Project Overview
Complete ECG Analysis System with Vision Transformer and LLM Integration

## Key Components
1. **Signal Processing** - Traditional ECG analysis with PQRST delineation
2. **ViT-ECG Model** - Vision Transformer for cardiac classification  
3. **LLM Integration** - Clinical report generation
4. **Complete Pipeline** - End-to-end ECG-to-report workflow

## Dataset
- PTB-XL: 21,837 ECG records from 18,885 patients
- 12-lead ECG data with expert annotations
- 5-class cardiac condition classification

## Status
✅ Core system completed and tested
⏳ Production API in development
